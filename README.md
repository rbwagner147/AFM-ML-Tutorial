## Application of Logistic Regression on AFM Data to classify surface contact 

This is a tutorial showing an example of applying logistic regression on AFM to classify them into two categories based on whether the AFM tip has made contact with the material surface or not.

# 1. Importing Basic Functions

## Theory

This tutorial requires primarily all the basic functions needed by a mathematical alogrithm. These include the NumPy library, Matplotlib and math libraries. Furthemore, the logistic regression tools require the Scikit-Learn library. 





```python

```

# 2. Importing Data Files

## Theory

We need to import data 



```python

```

# 3. Organizing Files into Directory

## Theory

Keys are specified in dictionaries to reference specific file names. Here we create two keys: Key 1: whether file is On SUrface or Off Surface file, Key 2: Specific file name 

Higher level



```python

```
